# Needs attention — Adam's inbox

Note that [TODO.md](/TODO.md) is the project's inbox; use that one for tasks that might be suitable for an LLM to do. This file is Adam's inbox; it's for stuff that needs his attention. AIs can put stuff in here if they want; see [task autonomy tiers](./workflow/task-tiers.md).

When an item from this page is done and no longer needs my attention, don't mark it "done", just delete it. I don't want this file to get cluttered with already-completed items.

> **Standing reminder:** the one-shot backlog lives in [`TODO.md`](/TODO.md).

> Trust → just do it). See [`task-tiers.md`](./workflow/task-tiers.md). The

## Main list

### Security/recoverability human actions

- Replace/scopedown external account tokens: Cloudflare scoped DNS token instead of global key; Render/Pinata scoped as narrowly as possible; OpenRouter spend limit.

### Fixes

- Make sure connecting a wallet actually works. Or if it just doesn't do it for a local deployment, let's make some way to fake connecting a wallet.

- On the real website:
  - Rename to aligning.works
  - "Traverse every link, build me a traversal graph for the entire site."? (Sam just did this: https://sitemap.stinger-bot.tech/)


### Features that I'm realizing would make a big difference

- (Maybe Sam will do this?) For suggesting possible statements you might want to sign: maybe a UI with sliders? Left/right, inflammatory/noninflammatory, etc. So it's not preachy, it just presents the options.

- Decide whether to prioritize a product/demo polish pass on the Commonality front door. Verifier product checks currently say the Commonality landing page has placeholder/leaked authoring-note copy and does not clearly state what the product is.

- Decide whether to prioritize a LazyGiving donor-page de-crypto pass. Verifier product checks currently say the donation page reads too crypto-heavy for ordinary donors (secondary market, buy/sell, burn tokens, raw addresses, IPFS/on-chain language, wallet-gated give CTA).

- Bridge-creator package is done; remaining work (CSM beat-agent stand-up, Civility-agent context source adapter, feeding signing outcomes into anchor reflection, and end-to-end rehearsal) is enumerated in [`bridge-creator-csm-next-steps.md`](workflow/bridge-creator-csm-next-steps.md). Mostly LLM-doable; the rehearsal pass needs your judgment.

- [ ] **(Ask)** Claim links for wallet-less donors: decide hosted vs. self-hosted Linkdrop relay (see [bridges.md](specs/tech/bridges.md#the-one-real-open-decision-hosted-vs-self-hosted-relay) for the full evaluation — Linkdrop SDK V3 is already the settled choice over a custom `TradFiBridgeEscrow`). Needs a small spike to confirm the relay self-hosts cleanly and check the per-claim fee/gas model.

- [ ] **(Ask)** Decide governance for the genuinely-governed `Ownable` levers (factory-authorization set, `setVerifier`/`setTrustedVerifier`) — needed before mainnet. Triage already done, see [security-recoverability.md](workflow/security-recoverability.md#governancetimelock-triage-for-the-human-held-ownable-levers). Decisions still mine: control model (multisig vs. timelock+multisig), delay length, and whether to do M-of-N attesters before mainnet.

### Testing/verification improvements

- Provision/fund the live-testnet verifier wallet (`COMMONALITY_TESTNET_VERIFIER_PRIVATE_KEY`) and, once it is safe to spend gas nightly, set `COMMONALITY_VERIFIER_NIGHTLY_ALLOW_TESTNET_MUTATION=1` in the deployment shell so `testnet.onchain-to-indexer` joins the retained deep cadence. Until this is done, `testnet.environment` will remain skipped-by-policy/uncertain for release-candidate claims. See `verifier/PLAN.md` P0/P1 item 1.

- Switch from this TODO.md to GitHub issues? At the very least let's have a process for turning one into the other. Add a "post a GitHub issue" button in the UI.

### Documentation

- Improve the second draft of the [pitch for Christians](docs/founder/christian-pitch.md) (I don't love it yet).
  - The idea of the second draft is to focus less on the "let's build a coordination mechanism for cross-denominational stuff" and more on making a Christian-branded entry point for Civility and CSM.
    - Go looking for Bible quotes aligned with Civility and bridge-building: blessed are the peacemakers, let there be no divisions among you, etc. Start with a review of the NT teachings on getting along with the people you disagree with, and that kind of stuff.
    - Commonality is "listen and engage", Christianity is "love them" (which does include telling them hard things that they don't want to hear, etc.).

- (Mostly done, or at least I've made a first pass at them. I still have Commonality and CSM to go through.) Go through each of the eight UI domains manually (just go to http://localhost:8088/ and open each in a new tab). Talk with Opus about each of them; make sure each makes sense to me (fix the copy if it doesn't feel right); make sure each has docs specific to it, make sure those make sense too, make sure each has a clear home in this repo's "docs" directory.

- Take a look at [what-its-better-for.md](docs/end-user/commonality/vision-and-strategy/why-its-better/what-its-better-for.md) and rewrite it a bit - there's something important there but I don't love the writeup.

- Can we make a diagram/infographic to explain the content-funding token system?

- Potential renames:
  - Content Funding -> LazyPatronage?
  - Alignment/Aligning -> LazyCause?

### Stuff I want to think through

- Can we think of ways to make the trust-graph thing less onerous, or (probably more importantly) to make it easier for the projects to display their credentials / bona fides in various verifiable ways (so that the system in general is less vulnerable to spam and sabotage)? See [alignment-anti-abuse.md](specs/product/alignment-anti-abuse.md).

- Let's have a separate session where we try to figure out how to offer a really smooth path for various kinds of use cases:
  - funding a local community thing
  - some org matching donations
  - credible threat to deter defunding
  - tip-jar migration for creators/OSS
  - "movements" that make use of this infrastructure with a particular focus


### Testing

## Before testnet

See [testnet-prep.md](./testnet-prep.md).

## After MVP

- Read [mvp.md](specs/product/mvp.md) and do the stuff that comes after.
