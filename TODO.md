# To Do

## Main list

- Alignment Explorer/seed AI outputs: Alignment `/explore` needs useful curated cause/statement content before testnet. The local demo seed already publishes deterministic `fundable-project-explorer` curated-collection/nudge/implication fixtures; verify the Alignment UI presents them well, decide whether deterministic fixtures are sufficient for testnet or whether to run/cache the Explorer Curator once over demo seed data, and include aligned project attestations in the same seed-output bundle so funding portals demonstrate real project lists. Tally intentionally has no `/explore` route for now.
- Seed alignment attestations: add at least a handful of project↔statement alignment attestations to the demo/testnet seed data so statement funding portals do not show “0 projects”.
- Do another smart-contract audit pass (with AI assistance, but I do want to look at the stuff myself).
  - First: which smart contracts are scary?

- skills: cofounder, noninteractive-assistant: Do a big high-level test of the whole project. Put the notes in `workflow/reviews/before-testnet.md`.

- Implement [beat agents](specs/tech/subsystems/content-funding/noninflammatory-content/beat-agents.md).

- Add Admin tabs to the UI. (What goes in it? And how do we get the UI to know that an admin is looking at it?)

- In general, I want to do more testing on the whole ecosystem of attesters and finders and nudgers, to make sure it all seems smooth.

- Move this repo to GitHub. Switch from this TODO.md to GitHub issues. Add a "post a GitHub issue" button in the UI.

- Register a single domain name (e.g. `commonality.xyz`) and set up subdomain-per-UI static hosting for testnet (e.g. `alignment.testnet.commonality.xyz`, `pubstarter.testnet.commonality.xyz`, etc.). No IPFS or ENS needed for testnet — just deploy the nine `dist/` directories to a static host (Render static sites, Netlify, etc.), configure DNS subdomains, and bake the `VITE_COMMONALITY_URL`, `VITE_PUBSTARTER_URL`, `VITE_ALIGNMENT_URL`, `VITE_DELEGATION_URL`, `VITE_TALLY_URL`, `VITE_CONTENT_FUNDING_URL`, `VITE_NONINFLAMMATORY_URL`, `VITE_CSM_URL`, and `VITE_CONCEPTSPACE_URL` env vars into the testnet build so cross-domain links resolve correctly. (For mainnet, register separate ENS names per domain so they're more independent.)

- (Not a task for AI.) Try out the UI manually.
- (Not a task for AI.) Do a big code review myself. I don't trust it.

- Keep working on [memes](specs/product/memes.md).
- Work on the [elevator pitch](docs/common-sense-majority/vision-and-strategy/elevator-pitch.md) for Common Sense Majority.
- Have AI generate some YouTube videos and podcasts and so on. Marketing, social media presence, etc.

- Try having an AI read *only* the docs and see whether the project makes sense. Prompt: "Read workflow/BLINDFOLDED.md and whatever files it tells you to read, nothing else. Then take a look at the UI and see if you can figure out what this app is for. Does it all make sense? Could you help a new user understand what it's for, what he might want to use it for, and how to get started? How could the new-user experience be improved?"
- Point an AI at the UI and tell it "go use this."
- Similar: "Go try to break the thing. You are a really good tester. Be adversarial."
- We'll need a lot more AI underlings, with good documentation, following all the pathways, trying all the things.

- Using `cofounder` skill: Are we ready to launch?

## Before testnet

## After MVP

- Read [mvp.md](specs/product/mvp.md) and do the stuff that comes after.
