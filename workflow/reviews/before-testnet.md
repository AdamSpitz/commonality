# Big review before deploying to testnet

(Late April 2026.)

We're getting close to having enough stuff implemented that it'd make sense to deploy to a real testnet, to practice the real deployment workflow to have a shared thing that we can point at and so on.

This is a very weird experience, though, because so much of this work has been done by LLMs, and I just don't have time to look at everything myself. OTOH, that's not *that* weird; in the real world, a CEO has to decide to ship the thing even though he hasn't seen all of it; he's relying on reports from his subordinates.

So what I want to do here is do a giant test run in which we review of all the user-facing surfaces of the project, using the `intelligent-tester` skill and the `cofounder` skill. (That is, we're not simulating new users seeing this for the first time with no knowledge of what it is; we're coming at it as the cofounders of the project, trying to make sure that the thing actually looks like it could accomplish the purposes of the project.)

I'm expecting to find a mix of problems: blatantly-broken things, things that just don't quite make sense, things that are missing ("why don't we have a page for viewing this particular kind of data"?), etc. 

For now, let's also use the `interactive-assistant` skill; I want to watch this step-by-step and get a feel for how well the ecosystem of skills is working.

## To Do

  - `large-task-manager`: This is the initial top-level task. Let's do it.
