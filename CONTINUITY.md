# Continuity notes for ephemeral AI instances

## Local deploy data persistence — COMPLETE ✓

### What was done

**Replaced hardhat node with Anvil** in `docker-compose.yml`. The `hardhat-node` service now uses `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest` running `anvil --host 0.0.0.0 --state /data/state.json`. Anvil's `--state` flag loads chain state on startup (if file exists) and saves it on clean exit.

Why not hardhat node: Hardhat 2.28.6 has no `--state` CLI flag, and `hardhat_dumpState`/`hardhat_loadState` JSON-RPC methods don't exist in this version. Anvil is a drop-in: same chain ID (31337), same default accounts, same JSON-RPC interface.

Entrypoint is explicitly overridden because the foundry image uses `ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c"]` which would swallow CLI args:
```yaml
entrypoint: ["anvil"]
command: ["--host", "0.0.0.0", "--state", "/data/state.json"]
```

`stop_grace_period: 30s` added so Anvil has time to write state.json before being killed.

Healthcheck updated to use `cast block-number` (bundled in foundry image).

**Deploy script idempotency** confirmed working — on restart with state loaded, deploy logs "Contracts already deployed on-chain — skipping redeployment."

**Data directory ownership fix:** `data.sh --wipe` (and `services.sh --start` and `run-integration-tests.sh`) all pre-create `$DATA_DIR/{hardhat,ipfs,ponder}` before `docker-compose up`, so Docker doesn't create them as root.

### Verified

Clean stop/start cycle confirmed working:
1. `./services.sh --stop` → Anvil writes `./data/hardhat/state.json`, Ponder's `./data/ponder/pglite` persists
2. `./services.sh --start` → Anvil loads same blocks, deploy skips, Ponder resumes from pglite with no reorg error
